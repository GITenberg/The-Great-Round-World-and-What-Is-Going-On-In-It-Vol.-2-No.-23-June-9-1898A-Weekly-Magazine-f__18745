<p>"It describes with artistic delicacy the transmission of that wonderful
thing called life in both the plant and animal existence. The difficult subject
is treated with such intelligence and charm of manner that children
may read it with interest, and parents need have no fear of its influence."&mdash;<i>The
Chicago Times.</i></p>

<p>"Something of flower life, something of fish life, of frogs, and of birds,
and a chapter on human life, form the subjects of this book,&mdash;all told in the
graceful manner of a womanly woman, whose love for nature has given her
a keener insight into nature's secrets, and a greater ability to impart those
secrets to others with the ease of face-to-face talks than is vouchsafed to
many people."&mdash;<i>The Boston Times.</i></p>

R. Smith. New York: William Beverley Harison. Price 36
cents, postpaid.</div>

<p>"Four True Stories of Life and Adventure," by Jessie R. Smith.
This is a book to be read by children, not to them. A child during
the years of seven and nine is usually hungering for true stories, and
some mothers and teachers try to meet the demand by reading and
telling "true" stories to them. This is well and good, but it is clear
that if this inborn craving could be met by books framed in language
of such limited vocabulary and construction that so young a child
would constantly be invited to the story, how valuable it would be.
This book is designated to meet this end. Less than 750 different
words are used in the entire series, and these, excepting the necessary
geographical names, are all in the commonest use among children.
The stories are of Columbus, Captain John Smith, Miles Standish,
Benjamin Franklin. Mothers and teachers with children of from
seven to nine years of age will give this book a hearty welcome&mdash;the
teachers because the market supply is so painfully deficient in this
line, and the mothers because it will so admirably solve the oft-repeated
query of "Mother, what can I do next?" It is so well gotten
out and still so cheap that it should have a large sale.&mdash;<i>Mother's
Journal, March, 1898.</i></p>

received many requests for missing numbers,
also suggestions that some sort of
cover or holder should be supplied, in or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>der
that numbers might be kept together, constant
reference being made to back numbers, the loss of one
causing much <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'incovenience'">inconvenience</ins>. After giving the matter
careful study, we have at last succeeded in making a
handy case, in which the numbers as issued may be
inserted. This case is strongly bound in cloth, with
a handsome design on back and sides; the copies of
<span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> can be inserted without
mutilating them in any way, and be kept clean and

<h2>New Books</h2>

<p>"Manipulation of the Microscope," Edward
Bausch (Rochester: Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical
Co.). At this season of the year, when so many of
our readers are interested in the study of botany and
other nature work, the use of the microscope enters
largely into their work&mdash;and yet how few people really
understand this most useful instrument. The writer
of this admirable little book very sensibly assumes
that his readers are anxious to learn the subject from
its simplest form to the more complex details, and he
has therefore made a thoroughly useful book. Few
people realize the delight of using a microscope intelligently,
nor do they grasp the true value of even the
simple pocket forms of this invaluable little instrument.
If they did properly appreciate the microscope,
every boy would carry a two or three loop
lens, and find it as useful almost as the indispensable
jackknife. The wonders of field, forest, and seashore
are not thoroughly appreciated unless the microscope
is used&mdash;<i>intelligently</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span></p>

<p>In our last number we give a review of the first
month of the war. In glancing over the news, it
is extremely interesting to contrast the losses of Spain
with those of the United States. In the campaign
off Cuba, we have had less than thirty men killed and
wounded, whereas the Spaniards have lost several
hundreds; they have had many of their fortifications
destroyed, and have suffered great damage in other
ways&mdash;by the capture of vessels, etc. In the far East,
Spain's fleet was destroyed, and many men killed and
wounded; against this was a loss on our part of one
man killed and six wounded, and approximately no
damage to our vessels.</p>

<p>The escape of the <i>Oregon</i> is considered another victory
for us, as during that trip of about fifteen thousand
miles she might easily have been intercepted and
destroyed had she not been splendidly handled. Her
run of four thousand miles between San Francisco
and Callao (cal-ye-&auml;-o) is the longest ever made by a
battle-ship without stop, and in the latter part of her
trip, on one long stretch, she averaged over fifteen
knots, a wonderful speed at the end of a trip of over
ten thousand miles&mdash;for a vessel's bottom becomes
very foul with barnacles, seaweed, etc., which greatly
retard its passage through the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span></p>

<p>It is reported that, while coaling at Rio, a number
of dynamite-bombs were smuggled into the coal, but
fortunately they were discovered by the sailors.</p>

<p>Action in reference to neutrality has been taken
by Russia, Greece, Venezuela, the Netherlands,
and Canada. The declaration of neutrality by Venezuela
is of special importance, as Spain's fleet would
have found Venezuelean ports of inestimable value as
places of refuge and for the purpose of coaling.
Venezuela expresses her position in the one sentence:
"The Republic will observe the strictest
neutrality during the contest." No statement is
made, however, as to what will be considered contraband.</p>

<p>The Dutch proclamation of neutrality, in addition
to the usual forms, especially cautions the citizens of
the Netherlands against becoming connected in any
way with privateering; and the Dutch vessels are also
required to respect the blockade; in reference to coal,
the Dutch regulation is that only enough shall be sold
to permit Spanish or American vessels to reach the
nearest port of their country.</p>

<p>The Russian proclamation contains a statement to
the effect that the Imperial Government, in concert
with the other powers, had endeavored to find a
means which would prevent an armed conflict between
the two countries; that such friendly measures were
without result, and that the Imperial Government
"witnesses with regret the armed conflict between
two states to which she is united by old friendship
and deep sympathy; it is firmly resolved in regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
to the two belligerents that a perfect and impartial
neutrality will be observed."</p>

<p>Greece has simply declared that the strictest neutrality
will be maintained.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, President McKinley issued a
call for 75,000 additional volunteers; of the
previous volunteers called for, about 112,000 have
been mustered into the army; with the addition that
is now called for, the army will number about 250,000;
and it is expected that active operations will be
begun at once, and that Porto Rico as well as Cuba
will be seized at the earliest possible moment; it is
expected that part of our fleet will proceed at once to
San Juan, Porto Rico, and destroy the fortifications
there, so that our army can without serious opposition
land on the island.</p>

<p>The cruiser <i>Columbia</i>, which was disabled in a
collision off Long Island, is being rapidly repaired
in the Brooklyn Navy-Yard. If she had not
been very strong there is little doubt but that the
<i>Foscolia</i> would have cut her in two; the frames of the
vessel, however, are so well constructed that these,
with the protective deck, prevented more serious damage.
Naval officers are very much pleased to find how
well the vessel withstood the collision; they say that
if the <i>Columbia</i> had been a ship like the large ocean
liners, nothing would have prevented her sinking
with the ship that struck her. When the officer on
the <i>Columbia</i> saw that a collision was inevitable, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
gave the order "Full speed ahead"; it is very fortunate
that he did so, as otherwise the <i>Foscolia</i> would
have hit her amidships; and the damage must then
have been very serious, as the water compartments in
that part of the vessel are large, and when filled
might have caused her to capsize. The damage
proves to be much less severe than was at first
thought; after two or three weeks it is thought she
will be on duty again.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the <i>Columbia</i> has
been in trouble of this kind; two years ago she collided
with the <i>Wyanoke</i>, a coasting steamer; in spite
of the trying circumstances at that time, not a man
was lost on the sinking coaster, so perfect was the
discipline on the <i>Columbia</i>.</p>

<p>It is reported that the balloons recently received
from Paris will be sent forward with the first expedition
to Cuba; arrangements for equipping the
balloon train are under charge of Lieut. Joseph E.
Maxfield of the Signal Service. It is reported that
one of the French balloons will be first given a careful
test from the deck of one of the war-ships off
Cuba. The necessary plant for generating the gas
is already in Tampa; the gas will be forwarded in
steel tubes, which will hold a large volume when the
gas is compressed.</p>

<p>It is now proposed to take the necessary apparatus
to Cuba, and have pictures of the bombardment
of Havana and of other engagements made for reproduction
with the cinematograph. Dr. D. S. Elmen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[721]</a></span>dorf
is now at Tampa, Fla., making elaborate preparations
for taking these pictures. The cinematograph
is a wonderful invention. By a clever arrangement
hundreds of photographs are taken, one after the
other, with marvellous rapidity; these pictures are
printed on a long strip, and made to pass through
the magic lantern as rapidly as when the photographs
were taken; the result is a composite picture
which, when thrown upon a screen, reproduces every
motion.</p>

<p>Edison was the one who invented this system of
taking in succession very rapidly a great number of
pictures of moving objects. We hope that Dr. Elmendorf
will be successful, for we will then be able
to see these interesting scenes; and if by a clever use
of the phonograph or graphophone he can record the
sound of the guns, we may not only see, but hear, the
battles.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> last year we described
experiments that were being made with kites by
Mr. W. E. Eddy, of Bayonne, N. J., who has been
largely instrumental in promoting interest in scientific
kite-flying. Kites have been made of such power
as to carry a heavy cable from one point to another
over some obstruction, or to lift a man some distance
from the ground for the purpose of observation. It
is now planned to make use of the kites for offensive
and defensive purposes in connection with the invasion
of Cuba. These kites can be raised to an enormous
height and photographs taken of the country,
or, if necessary, by a clever device which slides on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
the string of the kite, dynamite can be carried to a
point over the enemies' camp or fortifications and
dropped into them.</p>

<p>It is also believed that the kite will be of great
value for signalling purposes, especially at night, as
it will be possible to hoist electric incandescent lamps
to a great height above the earth and signal by turning
the light on or off in accordance with a settled
code. Mr. Eddy estimates that it will be possible to
drop fifty pounds of dynamite at a time from a distance
a mile away; the plan is to send up these kites
from within the lines of the attacking force and drop
the dynamite into the fortifications of Havana. The
men who fly the kites can remain out of sight of the
forts; and the kite will be such a small mark and so
high up in the air as to be very difficult to hit with a
rifle-ball.</p>

<p>After a great deal of discussion in Congress, and
many delays in finishing our war-ships because
of the price asked for armor by the large armor companies,
it was decided that the maximum rate&mdash;that
is, the highest price&mdash;that the Government would pay
should be $400 per ton; until this change was made
neither of the great armor-plate manufacturers would
bid, and, as a result, armor was not obtainable. May
24th, bids were opened for supplying the three battle-ships,
<i>Illinois</i>, <i>Alabama</i>, and <i>Wisconsin</i>, now being
constructed by the Union Iron Works, Newport News.
About a year ago the Government advertised for bids
for supplying this armor, but no bids were received
because Congress had made the limit of price too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
low. Bids opened on the 24th were from two companies,
the Bethlehem Iron Works and Carnegie &amp;
Co. It is evident that an arrangement had been entered
into between the two, as one company bid to
supply the armor for the <i>Alabama</i>, and the other for
the <i>Wisconsin</i>, the bids in each case being the same&mdash;that
is, at the maximum price of $400 per ton.</p>

<p>The armor for the <i>Alabama</i> will cost $1,022,504;
that for the <i>Wisconsin</i>, $1,023,504; the first of this
armor will be delivered in about seven months, and
thereafter about 300 tons will be delivered monthly.
At this rate it will be about fifteen months before the
last of the armor is ready.</p>

<p>It is reported that Spain is about to sanction the
commission or fitting out of privateers to prey
upon our commerce. In the Spanish newspapers appear
almost daily criticisms of our <i>cowardly</i> methods
of carrying on the war. At one time it is stated that
our vessels have been seen flying the Spanish flag in
order that they may surprise some ship of theirs; at
another time our <i>cowardly</i> attack upon some fort in
Cuba is mentioned, when we sneak up under cover of
darkness only to beat a hasty retreat when the first
gun is fired.</p>

<p>In the face of such conduct, it is claimed by the
Spaniards that we are entitled to no consideration,
and it is believed both here and abroad that all of
this kind of absurd talk means that Spain contemplates
a resort to privateers to get even with us.</p>

<p>Privateers, in former years, when fitted out by
Spain have acted so much like pirates that they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
been considered and treated as such by England and
by other nations, and the whole system has been so
seriously condemned that it is believed that, should
either Spain or this country fit out privateers, other
nations would immediately interfere and put a stop
to it.</p>

<p>There has been considerable discussion in reference
to Hawaii; the question of annexation is
favored almost universally by our people and in Congress;
in fact, the annexation of the island is now
considered not merely advisable, but absolutely necessary.
In sending troops from this country to the
Philippine Islands we must stop on the way for supplies,
and should Hawaii be captured by the Spaniards
or annexed by another power, it would prove a
very serious matter to us; it is to be hoped that the
question of annexation will be settled at once.</p>

<p>Very little news of interest is received from Spain.
In the list of the new Spanish ministry, published
week before last, we included the name of
Se&ntilde;or Leon y Castillo as Minister of Foreign Affairs;
Se&ntilde;or Castillo did not accept the office, which was
then offered to Duke Almodovar de Rio, who has
accepted.</p>

<p>The duke said that he did not wish the office, but
accepted it on patriotic grounds, "as every Spaniard
is bound to devote all his powers to the defence of
his country." The duke is well and favorably known
in England, where he was educated, and it is considered
that the choice for this office is a good one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish Minister of Finance, in discussing
Spain's financial condition, recently said that he considered
it satisfactory, and that the payment of all
expenses of the war is assured; as a means of raising
additional funds he proposes to convert the floating
debt, now amounting to about 500,000,000 pesetas,
into treasury bonds of small denomination, and to
extend the Bank of Spain note issues. Spain may
by this issue of additional paper money find herself
in as unfortunate a position as did Cuba when Weyler
endeavored to force paper money upon the people
there. With an increase of twenty per cent. on taxes
of all kinds, and with a paper money of doubtful
value, Spain will indeed be in a sorry predicament.</p>

<p>Later reports from Spain would indicate that a
crisis is approaching; business is at a standstill,
and a famine imminent, as provisions are so high as
to place them beyond the reach of the poorer people.
It is thought that if an encounter with our fleet ends
in disaster to Admiral Cervera, a revolution is inevitable.
It is said that Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria has advised the Queen to leave the country,
but that she has expressed her determination to remain
and face the result.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Carranza, to whom we are indebted
for the admirable explanation of why
Spain should not be held responsible for the <i>Maine</i>
disaster, published in <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> some
weeks ago, is having an unpleasant time in Canada.
Together with several other Spanish officials he has
been carrying on an "information bureau" for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
Spanish Government; by information bureau we mean
a system of receiving and forwarding reports to the
Spanish Government in reference to our fortifications,
etc. The present trouble has arisen from the fact
that a letter containing important information has
been mislaid; he accuses Joseph Kellert, a Montreal
detective, and two other persons of entering his room
and stealing this letter. They are making such a fuss
over the matter that the letter must have been an
exceedingly important one.</p>

<p>The first shipment of troops to the Philippine Islands
started May 25th on the three transports, <i>City
of Pekin</i>, <i>Australia</i>, and <i>City of Sydney</i>. When these
vessels left San Francisco, late in the afternoon, the
shores were lined with people, and there was great
enthusiasm. These three transports carry about
twenty-five hundred men; the expedition is under
command of Brigadier-General Anderson, and consists
of four companies of regulars under Major Robe;
the First Regiment California Volunteers, Colonel
Smith; the First Regiment Oregon Volunteers, Colonel
Summers; and a battalion of fifty heavy artillery,
Major Gary; and in addition to these a number of
sailors, naval officers, a large amount of ammunition
and naval stores for Admiral Dewey's fleet, and supplies
sufficient to last a year. It was expected that
the fleet would arrive at the Sandwich Islands by
Tuesday, May 31st; it will proceed from this port in
company with the <i>Charleston</i>, and should arrive at
Manila about June 20th. A detachment of the United
States Engineers was ordered from Willets Point,
N. Y., to the Philippines, under command of Captain
Langfitt; Captain Langfitt is an expert in the matter
of torpedoes and harbor defences of this kind, and
it is thought that his mission at the Philippines will
be to fortify the different harbors by planting mines,
torpedoes, etc.</p>

<p>Now that the reinforcements are well on their way,
there is no reason to feel any anxiety in reference to
any expedition which might be sent from Spain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
The shortest route from Cadiz is, of course, by way
of the Suez Canal; the distance by this route is over
8,000 miles; from San Francisco to Manila, by way
of the Sandwich Islands, is but 7,000 miles; therefore
we have at least a week the start of any expedition
which might leave Spain. The troops sent on the
three transports which sailed May 25th will be sufficient
to garrison Corregidor Island; with strong fortifications
on this island at the entrance of Manila Bay,
it is believed that we can prevent the entrance of any
fleet. The only fleet which it is possible for Spain
to send at this time is Admiral Camara's; in this
there are but two armorclads, the <i>Pelayo</i> and <i>Emperadar
Carlos V</i>. Admiral Dewey would not consider
them sufficiently formidable to give him any anxiety.</p>

<p>Unless we meet with misfortune or great reverses
in dealing with the Spanish forces now at the Philippines,
there is little doubt but that they are ours by
this time.</p>

<p>Now that the Philippine Islands are to be kept
by us, the previous regulations in reference to
mails have been changed. When war was declared
the Post-Office Department shut off communication
with the Philippine Islands, as well as with other
Spanish countries. A new order has been issued,
and mail may now be sent to the Philippine Islands
by way of San Francisco. In times of war this country
permits soldiers to mail letters to their homes
without prepaying postage; this is a great advantage
to them, as we can readily understand that while on
a campaign post-offices cannot be reached and postage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
stamps are not easy to get. The officers or men have
simply to write on the letters, "Soldier's letter,"
"Sailor's letter," "Marine's letter," and they will be
carried by post to their destination and postage collected
there without extra charge. Under ordinary
circumstances letters will not be carried unless partly
prepaid; and if foreign postage is not fully prepaid a
penalty in the shape of extra postage is added to the
regular rate, and collected upon delivery.</p>

<p>European powers are watching with great interest
our movements in the East. Admiral
Dewey's victory, it is considered, has put an end to
Spanish sovereignty in the East. European governments
evidently expect the United States to keep the
Philippines, and it is difficult to see any other solution,
as it will certainly not be advisable to return the
islands to Spain, nor would this be consistent with
the "war for humanity's sake." Spain's cruelties in
the Philippines have been even more excessive than
in Cuba, and we certainly should not again place the
islands in the hands of that cruel taskmaster, Spain.
It has been suggested that we cede them to some European
power; the question is, Can we do this? These
powers are so jealous of each other that they will not
stand quietly by and see any one of their number
favored by a gift of such importance; on the other
hand, the presence of an American colony in Eastern
Asia will be a thorn in the side of the great powers;
we have, therefore, to choose which horn of the dilemma
we shall accept. The final settlement of the matter
will, no doubt, cause many new complications and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
material changes in the traditional policy of our Government.</p>

<p>The mysterious sailing of the steamship <i>Adria</i>
from Key West, a week ago, has attracted a
good deal of comment; it is said that she had on
board many miles of submarine cable, together with
the necessary appliances for grappling, splicing, and
laying, and telegraphic instruments for use on shore.
It is believed that the purpose is to cut the cable
off shore, splice a piece to it, and carry it to some
unfrequented spot and there establish a cable station;
this would enable our authorities to communicate
quickly with Washington&mdash;when the invasion of Cuba
takes place, or to keep the insurgents advised as to
our movements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/tb.png" width="300" height="16" alt="Divider" title="Divider" />

<p>A very interesting question of international law
has been brought up by the cutting of the
cables by Admiral Dewey; it is claimed that by
doing this he has established an international precedent,
for his cutting of the cable connecting a country
at war with another country is a forcible interference
with communication which has not been practised
in any previous war.</p>

<p>The question of cable-cutting has never come up
before as a means of offensive warfare, as it is only
in recent years that there has been any extensive laying
of cables. Dewey's example has been followed
by the blockading fleet off Cuba; this fact establishes
beyond all peradventure the position that this Gov<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>ernment
has assumed. The British Government evidently
believes that in the time of war the right to
cut cables connecting the opposing nation with other
countries is one which may be assumed without violation
of international law. In a speech on this matter,
Mr. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, quoting
in Parliament a few days ago an agreement made in
Paris in 1884, in reference to the protection of cables
by different nations, said: "By Article XV. of this
convention, in time of war a belligerent signatory
to the convention (that is, a county signing this
agreement) is as free to act with respect to submarine
cables as if the convention did not exist. I am not
prepared, therefore, to say that a belligerent, on the
ground of military exigency, would under no circumstances
be justified in interfering with cables between
the territory of the opposing power and any other
part of the world."</p>

<p>Our State Department considers that this statement
on the part of Great Britain commits that country to
the policy regarding cables which we have recently
put into practice; her approval of our action virtually
establishes this right as a principle of international
law.</p>

<p>Very serious trouble is anticipated in Italy because
of the hopeless poverty of much of the
peasantry, and the apparent inefficiency of the present
system of government. The Italian peasant barely
succeeds under the most advantageous circumstances
in obtaining food enough for himself and family; consequently
every change in the price of bread is a se<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>rious
matter to him; under the present Government
the taxes have become heavier, and this is sure at no
distant date to bring about a crisis; that this crisis
is near is shown by the recent bread riots. The only
hope of averting trouble is a change in the policy of
the Italian Government.</p>


<p>Many people in Europe are asking why the price
of wheat continues to advance, as there is apparently
no reason, for the Spanish-American war has created
no increased demand, nor has it seriously interfered
with the shipment of grain. The increase in price is
accounted for, by those who are familiar with these
subjects, on the ground that there seems to be a general
conspiracy to hold back supplies from Europe in
the hope of obtaining higher prices, and in consequence
scarcity is created in certain markets, thus
causing the rise in price both there and elsewhere,
and with each rise in price comes additional reason
for the holding back of supplies on the part of the
speculators who are manipulating the market.</p>

<p>It is rather interesting to turn from the account of
the riots in Italy to a brief history of Joseph
Leiter's famous wheat deal. This wheat deal, which
has just been closed, is the most remarkable that has
ever been known in the history of the grain markets.
Leiter has not only made himself rich, but has added
to the wealth of the farmers in the West enormously.
Every effort on the part of other speculators to force
Leiter to the wall has been unsuccessful. Last fall
when he was buying, they turned over enormous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
quantities of wheat, but he seemed to have untold
millions at his command, for he met every offer with
cash, and demonstrated that he had more money if
they could furnish more wheat: the result was that
wheat went up, up, up, until it reached nearly $2 a
bushel, and Leiter has made, it is estimated, over
$4,000,000, or nearly $500 <i>an hour</i> since April of last
year.</p>

<p>The account of the troubles in Italy, and the great
prosperity resulting from Leiter's success here, simply
demonstrate what has been called attention to
before&mdash;that what affects one part of the world has
its influence upon the rest. A contribution from the
prospered wheat farmers (and Leiter) to the suffering
poor in Italy would not be amiss under the circumstances.</p>

<p>In our recent numbers we mentioned the trouble in
the Sierra Leone Protectorate. This trouble has
been ascribed to the hut tax; this tax is practically
the only tax levied upon the natives, and it is for the
purpose of raising sufficient revenue to prevent slave-trading.
The trouble in this colony has arisen indirectly,
not directly, as a result of this tax, as the
slave-traders have used it as a pretext for stirring
up the rebellion among the natives. England for
many years has been doing her best to suppress
slave-trading, and the slave-traders make use of any
grievance, imaginary or otherwise, in their attempts
to overthrow the power of the white men, in order
that their barbarous man-hunting may not be interfered
with. Several men-of-war have been sent by
England to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sierre'">Sierra</ins> Leone, and are to be reinforced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
others; troops have also been sent to the assistance
of the missionaries and others whose lives are endangered
by the uprising of the natives.</p>

<p>Day by day news from this district becomes more
alarming; all of this part of Africa is at the present
time in a state of great excitement, and it is expected
that great difficulty will be experienced in suppressing
the revolt. Early in May, the rebels attacked the
American mission at Rotufunk and killed five of the
American missionaries&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Kane, Miss
Archer, Miss Hatfield, and Miss Schenck. Their
bodies have been recovered.</p>

<p>The hut tax, which has been made a pretext for all
this trouble, amounts to about one shilling a year for
each member of the population, or, in case of families,
five shillings for each family. The insurrection was
started by a native chief who has given the colonial
government much trouble heretofore.</p>

<p>During the latter part of May there were first
rumors, then reports, and then confirmed reports
that the Spanish fleet was at Santiago, Cuba,
and that it was caught as in a trap by our war-vessels.</p>

<p>The harbor of Santiago is a deep one, with a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
narrow mouth, as stated in a recent issue of <span class="smcap">The
Great Round World</span>. The Navy Department feels
extremely happy over the locating of the Spanish
fleet and the fact that it may be kept where it is for
the present; this will make possible the invasion of
Cuba and the carrying out of the general plans of the
campaign without fear of having them interrupted by
attack from the Spanish vessels. Santiago is not
very well supplied with provisions, and it will be but
a question of time when the Spanish fleet must either
force their way out of the harbor or else surrender.
It is to be hoped that the capture of this fleet will be
accomplished without battle, for battle will mean a
large loss on both sides, and it can have but one ultimate
outcome. The inevitable may be deferred, but
the United States is pretty sure to win in the long
run.</p>

<p>One or two of our battle-ships or monitors stationed
at the entrance of the harbor will be sufficient to prevent
the exit of the Spaniards, even if we do not succeed
in so blocking the channel with obstructions as
to make exit impossible; this will leave the rest of
our fleet free to operate elsewhere. Great vigilance
will be exercised to prevent the Spanish torpedo-boats
from running out and attacking our vessels under
cover of darkness. The entrance to the harbor is so
narrow that a patrol of small boats can be established,
making such an attack almost impossible.</p>

<p>Cables connecting Cuba with the world outside are
being rapidly located and cut, and by the time this
paper goes to press Cuba will no doubt be cut off entirely,
and we will cease to see reports from Madrid of
what is going on in Havana and elsewhere in Cuba.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span></p>

<p>May 31st Commodore Schley made an attack
upon the forts at the entrance to the
harbor of Santiago, with the intention of
ascertaining the position and strength of
the fortifications. At one o'clock in the afternoon
of that day the signal to form column was hoisted
on the <i>Massachusetts</i>; the <i>New Orleans</i>, <i>Iowa</i>, and
<i>Vixen</i> followed her as she steamed slowly toward
the harbor entrance. When between three and four
miles from shore two of her 13-inch guns were fired;
it is reported that one of the shells struck the
partly dismantled Spanish war-ship <i>Reina Mercedes</i>,
crashing through her bow and killing a number
of men; two shots followed quite near the same
vessel; the two guns in the forward turret sent their
projectiles so close to the Spanish flagship that the
spray was thrown all over her. The shore batteries
at this time began a rapid fire on the <i>Massachusetts</i>,
but she was soon beyond their range. The fire
was then turned on the <i>New Orleans</i>; the shells from
this vessel struck the large battery on the hill above
Morro Castle, and a great cloud of dust and d&eacute;bris
rose in the air as the shells burst. They must have
done considerable damage; the shells which followed
sent portions of the wall of Morro Castle tumbling
down, a mass of ruins. Almost every shot found a
mark in either the batteries or vessels. It was the
<i>Iowa's</i> turn next; her shells made things lively for
the Spanish fleet in the harbor, although it is believed
she was not successful in hitting any of the Spanish
vessels. The little <i>Vixen</i> swept along after her predecessors,
and banged away with her one 6-pounder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
with as great an air of importance as if it had been a
13-inch rifle; then she steamed away in a triumphant
manner, as much as to say: "I have done my share."
The commodore promptly ordered her to keep out
of danger. The ironclads turned, and a second time
bore down on the harbor, and when within five miles
the shells began again to fall thick and fast around
the Spanish vessels, although accurate firing was
almost out of the question, as the vessels were behind
the hill out in sight, and range could not be ascertained.
The Spaniards kept up a brisk cannonade
long after our vessels had stopped firing; a tremendous
amount of damage was done&mdash;to the Caribbean
Sea; their shells did not come within a mile of our
vessels.</p>

<p>June 3d the auxiliary cruiser <i>St. Paul</i> returned to
New York, after a two weeks' cruise in West Indian
waters; she had been detailed for guard and scout
duty, and was one of the first to discover the Spanish
fleet in Santiago Bay. She left Key West May 18th,
and arrived off Santiago about the 20th. The St.
Louis had been detailed for similar service, and had
been watching Santiago harbor with the expectation
that the Spanish vessels would attempt to enter there;
she, however, left on the 19th. It is supposed that
Admiral Cervera must have entered the harbor in the
twenty-four hours between this date and that of the
arrival of the <i>St. Paul</i>.</p>

<p>As it was advisable that her whereabouts should not
be discovered to the Spaniards, the <i>St. Paul</i> cruised
backward and forward about twenty miles out; she
kept this distance off shore in order that the Spanish
torpedo-boats might not make a dash out of the har<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>bor
in the darkness and torpedo her. It was not
until the 23d that anything was seen of the Spaniards.
Captain Sigsbee is quite confident that on this date
he identified the <i>Vizcaya</i>, the <i>Christopher Colon</i>, and
several torpedo-boat destroyers within the harbor;
they were evidently making preparations for departure,
but were too late, as our fleet under Commodore
Schley reached the harbor before they could get away.</p>

<p>The only excitement that the <i>St. Paul</i> had was the
capture of the collier <i>Restormel</i>. The vessel was
sighted very early one morning about five miles from
the harbor entrance, running with all speed to obtain
the protection of the batteries on shore. The <i>St.
Paul</i> was too quick for her; crowding on all steam,
the collier was soon overtaken and stopped by a solid
shot fired across her bows. A prize crew was put on
board and the vessel sent to Key West.</p>

<p>The <i>St. Paul</i> is off again; her destination is, however,
a secret.</p>

<p>Another "great victory" was reported by the Spaniards
on June 4th. In the despatch from Madrid it
was stated that one of our most powerful vessels attempted
to enter the harbor of Santiago de Cuba and
had been blown up by a torpedo and sunk, her crew
of six men and one officer being captured. There was
something very inconsistent about the statement
"most powerful vessel" with a crew of six men and
one officer, but apparently the Spaniards overlooked
this. The fact of the matter is that Admiral Sampson
decided to close the harbor effectually, and in
order to do this sent the collier <i>Merrimac</i> to the entrance
of the channel and had her sunk there.</p>

<p>This brilliant exploit was planned by a young offi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>cer,
Lieut. Richmond Pearson Hobson, who with
seven volunteers carried it out in a most gallant way.</p>

<p>At this distance and without experience of the fearful
effect of modern gunnery, we cannot appreciate
what a dangerous errand these brave men undertook.
To sail close under the guns of many batteries and
forts, through a narrow channel known to be mined,
was to face death, and almost sure death&mdash;an act
which will make their names famous. Yet when volunteers
were called for, every man stepped forward
and begged to be taken.</p>

<p>At three o'clock Friday morning the <i>Merrimac</i>
started. In the darkness she succeeded in getting
well in shore before she was discovered; then shot
and shell made the water white with spray all
around her. But the brave fellows never flinched,
and on they sailed until the narrowest part of the
channel was reached. Down went the anchor, and
soon a dull report in her hold told of the successful
explosion of the torpedo which was to blow her
bottom out and make her sinking certain.</p>

<p>The crew left and succeeded in clearing the vessel
before she went down. But two are reported to
have been wounded, and these but slightly. All were
captured and taken to Morro Castle.</p>

<p>The great bravery of the gallant fellows was recognized
by Admiral Cervera and he sent a boat with
a flag of truce to advise Admiral Sampson that the
men were safe and would be exchanged. This act of
the Spanish admiral has won for him a feeling of
great admiration in this country. It was the act of
a noble man.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet is not only bottled up now, but
the cork is in the bottle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE FLAG.</h2>

<p>Many questions have reached us from subscribers
and friends concerning the meaning and reason
for the stars and stripes on the United States
flag, and how the United States came to choose the
colors and design of the flag.</p>

<p>Early in Revolutionary times, each colony had its
own flag, and they were very varied in design, and some
had strange designs. The colony of Massachusetts
had a pine-tree on its flag. South Carolina had a rattlesnake
on a yellow flag, and underneath the snake
the motto: "Don't tread on me." New York had a
white flag with a beaver on it; and Rhode Island a
white flag with a blue anchor.</p>

<p>Many variations of the "stars and stripes" are
found in the flags used during the first years of the
Revolution. Some have red and white stripes, with
the field (where the stars are in the flag we all know)
like the field of the British flag&mdash;red, white, and blue
lines crossing one another. This design in the corner
of a flag is called its "jack," and is often used
alone.</p>

<p>In 1777, Congress declared that the flag should
have thirteen horizontal stripes and thirteen white
stars on a blue field, each representing one of the
thirteen States. The idea of the adoption of the
grouping of stars and stripes was doubtless taken from
the arms of the Washington family, which consisted
of a white shield with two horizontal red bars, and
above these three red stars.</p>

<p>It was the original intention to add a stripe and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
star for each state admitted to the Union, and the
grouping of the equal stripes was supposed to represent
the unity of the Federation. In 1792 the stars
and the stripes were both increased to fifteen on account
of the admission to the Union of the States of
Vermont and Kentucky, and, after this, others were
added. In 1818, Congress decided to return to the
original thirteen stripes, and to add a star for each
new State, which plan has been followed since. The
three colors, red, white, and blue, symbolize valor,
purity, and truth.</p>

<p>The United States has but one national flag, which
is flown alike on buildings, men-of-war, and merchant
vessels, and to us Americans its purity and beauty
appeal strongly.</p>

<p>A number of the foreign nations have different
flags, known as the royal standard, the war flag, and
the merchant flag. For instance, Spain has the three.
The colors of Spain are red and yellow. The navy
flag consists of three horizontal stripes&mdash;yellow in the
middle, and a narrower red band at top and bottom.
On the yellow band near the staff is a coat of arms
surmounted by a crown. The merchant flag is made
up of five horizontal stripes&mdash;a yellow in middle, a
narrow red, then a narrow yellow, and then a broad
red above and below. The colors, red and yellow,
were the colors of the royal house of Aragon, whose
fortunes were closely allied with the Spanish crown.
The royal standard of Spain is an elaborate affair,
divided into four parts, containing the heraldic
arms of leading families of Spain, and many
devices indicating the control of Spain over countries
which it once held sway over, but which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
have long since been lost to her, as Holland, Portugal,
etc.</p>

<p>France uses the "tricolor," a flag of three vertical
equal stripes, red, white, and blue, the blue being
nearest the staff. France has undergone many political
changes, and this, the flag of the Republic, was
adopted in 1789.</p>

<p>Germany's national flag has a white ground, divided
into four parts by black lines&mdash;one broad black
line and a narrow one on each side. At the centre is
a circle containing the Prussian crowned eagle. The
upper quarter, by the staff, is divided into three equal
horizontal stripes, black, white, and red, and on these
is a Maltese cross&mdash;the iron cross of Germany.</p>

<p>The German merchant flag has red, white, and
black horizontal stripes.</p>

<p>Flags have grown by custom and international law
to represent nationality. If they are insulted the insult
is to the nation. In war they are protected by
lives, and in peace they pass around the world, or float
from their staffs on land&mdash;marks of their nation's
strength and supremacy.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
